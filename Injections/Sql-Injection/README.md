# SQL Injection
  
  SQL Injection can be used in a range of ways to cause serious problems. By levering SQL Injection, an attacker could bypass authentication, access, modify         and delete data within a database. In some cases, SQL Injection can even be used to execute commands on the operating system, potentially allowing an attacker     to escalate to more damaging attacks inside of a network that sits behind a firewall.

# Type of SQL Injection   
  
  SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi. You can classify SQL injections types based on the methods they use to access backend data and their damage potential.
    
   SQL Injection can be classified into three major categories – In-band SQLi, Inferential SQLi and Out-of-band SQLi.  
 
 
 
   # 1. In-band SQL Injection (Classic SQL Injection)
   The attacker uses the same channel of communication to launch their attacks and to gather their results. In-band SQL Injection simplicity and efficiency make      it one of the most common types of SQLi attack. 
   
   There are two sub-variations of this method:
        
   ## • Error-based SQL Injection
     
   Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQK Injection technique that relies on error messages thriwb by the database server to obtain information about the structure if    the datebase
   
   ## • Union-Based SQL Injection 
     
   Uion-based SQLi is ab ib-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements.
     
     
  # 2. Inferential SQL Inection (Blind SQL Injection) 
   The attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure. This method is called      blind SQLi because the data is not transferred from the website database to the attacker, thus the attacker cannot see information about the attack in-band.
  
  ##  Blind SQL Injection 
   it is just as dangerous as any other form of SQL Injection . In an Blind SQLi attack, no data is actually transferred via th eweb application and the attacker    woulf not be able to see the result of an attack
    
   ## The two types of Blind SQL Injection are:-
    
   - Boolean-based (content-based) 
  
   - Time-based Blind SQL Injection
   
  # 3. Out-of-band SQL Injection
  
   Out of band SQL injection is not very commaon, mostly because it depends on feature being enabled on the database server being used by the web application. Out    of band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is unable to use the same chennel to launch the attack and gather result.

# Broken authentication

Broken authentication refers to anything that lets someone log in to an account they’re not supposed to have access to. It means that there are vulnerabilities present in a particular website or application that lets an attacker sidestep the standard security measures in order to gain unauthorized entry. Basically, they are trying to log into a victim’s account like normal, with all the regular capabilities and functionality. Since they are impersonating the user, they can perform actions under the guise of their identity and may be able to view sensitive personal and financial information, as well.

<h3>Broken authentication has two different types of Vulnerabilities – </h3>

 # Session Management Vulnerabilities
 
  <p>In Session Management Vulnerabilities a session ID is created and assigned to a user whenever they log in to a site. The session ID is used to track what the user does and helps the site respond to the user’s actions.<br>
  <br>
  If an attacker can get a hold of a user’s session ID while they are logged in, then that is essentially as good as having their password. They can use the stolen session ID to impersonate the user and perform actions within the website. The image below illustrates how a session hijacking attack works:

 # Credential Management Vulnerabilities
 
   <p>
  The theft of usernames and passwords is the first thing that usually comes to mind when we think of attackers gaining unauthorized access to an application. Proper credential management is critical for the users of any system, and applications themselves must take all possible precautions when dealing with passwords and their creation.<br>
  <br>
  In this case, broken authentication occurs when a site fails to protect its users from attackers that try to gain access via hacked or stolen passwords.

 # Session Hijacking
   As we touched on earlier, hackers can use stolen session IDs to gain unauthorized access to a system and impersonate the victim within. These kinds of attacks can occur through attack vectors such as phishing attacks, public wi-fi sniffing, or malware.

 # Credential Stuffing
   When databases of unencrypted login credentials are leaked, hackers can use automated tools to test out the entries and determine if any are still valid. This is essentially a kind of brute force attack, and many applications have protections to guard against this method.

 # Password Spraying
   This is somewhat similar to Credential Stuffing in that it is a type of brute force attack. In this case though, attackers use lists of the most common and weak passwords. And as we saw earlier, this method often pays off considering how often “password”, “123456”, and similar strings are used as passwords. Password-complexity requirements help protect against Password Spraying. You can see some of the most commonly used (and therefore worst) passwords below:

 # Phishing Attacks
   Here, hackers use an authentic-looking login screen (like the one seen below) in an attempt to trick users into providing their credentials. These kinds of attempts can be prevented by avoiding suspicious links, verifying the website in question, and following email security best practices. Admins can protect their users’ accounts by implementing multi-factor authentication, so even if a phishing attack is successful there’ll be another hurdle the hacker has to clear before getting account access.

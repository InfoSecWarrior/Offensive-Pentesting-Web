# What Is Recon/Information Gathering ?
        It is the act of gathering preliminary data or intelligence on your target, the data is gathered in order to better plan for your attack. We can be performed it actively or passively

# What do we look for during Recon/Information Gahtering ?
        Info to increse attack surface(domains, net blocks)
        Credentials(emails, passwords, API Keys)
        Sensitive Information
        Infrastructure Details
        
# Types Recon/Information Gathering        

## Active Information Gathering
## Passive Information Gathering

# Sub-domain enumeration
        We can split this up in two different categories:
 
## Horizontal sub-domain enumeration
## Vertical sub-domain enumeration

        Horizontal sub-domain enumeration examples: www.google.com, dev.google.com, maps.google.com

        Vertical sub-domain enumeration are sites which are also used by the main domain. For example snapchat.com, snap.com, spectacles.com.
